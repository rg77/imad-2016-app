  <h3 style="text-align:center;">About me</h3>
  <p>Hi there! My name is Rohan. At present, I am a third year student pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s of Technology in Computer Engineering. </p>
  <p>I have completed the following projects:  </p>
  <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Ink It :</b><br/>
    'Ink It' is a blogging web application developed using Node.Js. While other users  can create their accounts and read & comment on the article posts, only the admin is allowed to post the article.This is my first web application and I learnt a lot about front-end and back-end development and web designing, picking up a lot of skills viz-Javascript,HHTML,CSS,e,.t.c.along the way.This app also made me understand in a better way, the Computer Network concepts that I learned in the class.
    This app was made as a part of the NPTEL MOOC -'Introduction To Web Application and Development'.

            <b>Gesture recognition based Presentation Control :</b><br/>
    In this project, I made a gesture recognition program using the C++ lang. and the  OpenCV library to control presentation using just one's hand.I employed colour based image sementaion.A left to right sweep changes the presentaion to next slide while a 
    sweep from right to left changes the presentation to the previous slide.

            <b>Document Clustering :</b><br/>
    Given an input string query, our aim was to get as an output, a set of documents ordered by how relevant they are to the given input  query. We used the Cosine similarity measure to measure the relevance.This was implemented in Java.

            <b>Proxy Generator :</b><br/>
    Normally in schools, the task of alloting teachers to fill in the proxy classes, is done manually.This is a very time consuming and troublesome process.So I made an intelligent program which would automatically create the best proxy time table by taking into cosiderations factors like - availability of  some other teacher  who teaches the subject teacher as that of the teacher who is absent, availablity of some other teacher who teaches the same class and had missed the class before due to absentism,e.t.c     This was implemented in c++.
